I am currently an undergraduate student at Universidade Federal do Ceará (UFC), in Fortaleza, Brazil. During the period
of September/2018 to September/2020 I have been a double degree student at Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA)
de Rennes, obtaining a Master's degree in Electronic Engineering.

Since 2016 I have been engaged in research projects. My research interests are mainly data science, statistical machine learning,
signal processing (specially image processing), and more recently, optimal transport.
