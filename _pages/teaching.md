## Teaching Assistant

_Control Systems, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Departamento de Teleinformática, 2018_

During the 2018.1 term, I was in charge of assisting PhD. Michela Mulas in an undegraduate-level course of Control Systems.

I was in charge of aiding students with problems and practical session solutions. Moreover, I had the opportunity of giving two lectures during the term.
