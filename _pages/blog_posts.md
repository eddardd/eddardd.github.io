## Undergraduate Level

### Derivatives

---
**[Lecture 1: Concepts](https://eddardd.github.io/posts/calculus/undergrad/lec1)**

In this post I will discuss the notion of derivative and how to compute them on different spaces, ranging from the real line, up to Euclidean spaces.

**[Lecture 2: Applications](https://eddardd.github.io/posts/calculus/undergrad/lec2)**

__WIP__ In this post I will discuss applications of derivatives in optimization, and in signal processing.

## Graduate Level

### Differential Geometry

---
**[Gradients in Generalized Coordinates](https://eddardd.github.io/posts/calculus/graduate/lec1)**

__WIP__ In this post I will discuss how Gradients in general coordinates systems through Tensor Calculus.
