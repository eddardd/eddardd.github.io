Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Engineering, Universidade Federal do Ceará, January/2015 - Present
* M.S. in Electronics and Industrial Informatics, Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rennes, September/2018 - August/2020

Work experience
======
* March 2020 - August 2020: Research Assistant in Artificial Intelligence
  * During this internship I was in charge of implementing Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation methods for a problem involving transfer learning on the classification of bacteria cell stain.
  * Supervisor: PhD. Fred-Maurice Ngolè Mboula

* Summer 2019: Research Assistant in Deep Learning
  * During this internship I was in charge of implementing a benchmark for comparing image denoising methods. A special focus was given to deep neural network methods.
  * The benchmark is Open Source, and its code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/opendenoising/)
  * Supervisor: Ms. C. Florian Lemarchand
